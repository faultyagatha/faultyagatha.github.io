I am a Berlin-based visual artist and creative technologist interested in how everyday encounter with technology changes 
the way we think of ourselves as humans. For me, technology is a “humanising” medium able not only to expand our creative 
potential and excite the imagination but also to teach us how to be humans in the first place and respect other possible 
forms of existence lying far beyond our understanding of life. This is what drives me, makes me believe in a better future, 
and intrinsically motivates me. 

In my art practice, I merge video, creative coding, and game design to create experimental visual experiences. 
I value equality, respect, and openness to the world and look forward to any kind of collaboration and creative exchange. 
If you think we could get creative together drop me a line at **faulty.agatha(at)gmail(dot)com.**
