I am a Berlin-based visual artist and creative technologist interested in how 
    everyday encounter with technology changes the way we think of ourselves as humans. 
    For me, technology is a “humanising” medium able not only to expand our creative 
    potential and excite the imagination but also to teach us how to be humans in the 
    first place and respect other possible forms of existence lying far beyond our 
    understanding of life. This is what drives me, makes me believe in a better future, 
    and intrinsically motivates me. 

    In my art practice, I merge video, creative coding, and game design to create 
    experimental visual experiences. I value equality, respect, and openness to 
    the world and look forward to any kind of collaboration and creative exchange. 
    If you think we could get creative together drop me a line at 
    **faulty.agatha(at)gmail(dot)com.**
